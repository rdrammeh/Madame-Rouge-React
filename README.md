## About the app
As a two-day client project, my team and I built a crowd sourced restaurant web application that allowed the owner of the restaurant to create and alter menus every week. The goals of this project was to practice agile workflow, create a backend API, become more comfortable with React JS, and to get some experience working with a client.

## Control Flow
When the app loads, you are presented with the current menu at Madame Rouge that week. The menus are pre-set and change every Sunday at 12am. As a user, you will have the ability to add new recipes to the website. Each user can add 1 recipe per food type. As the admin, in this case, Madame Rouge has unrestricted to the site. In the admin profile page, Madame Rouge can edit menus as well as create new menus for upcoming weeks.
